Appendix: SDAT structure
========================

This page explains how the files within an *SDAT* file relate to each other. There won't be anything specific to ndspy here, so if you already know how these are organized, you can continue to the next page.

Overview
--------

In most Nintendo DS games, a single *SDAT* file (often named *sound_data.sdat* or similar) will contain all of the game's sound data: all music and sound effects, in a single file. Some music is in the form of "streams" (similar to a *mp3* or *wav* file), but usually, to save memory, most or all of it will be in the form of "sequences" (similar to a `midi file <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI>`_). The instruments used to play the sequences contain streams for note sounds, and metadata. Sound effects are always sequences, although they usually use unique instruments made just for them, and are often only one note long.

*SDAT*\ : overall container
---------------------------

An *SDAT* ("sound data") file contains many *SWAR*, *SBNK*, *SSEQ*, *SSAR*, *Sequence player*, *STRM*, *Stream player*, and/or *Group* files. Some *SDAT* files include filenames for the files they contain, but this isn't a requirement; to save space, filenames are sometimes omitted. Games generally refer to these files by ID number, so this is only an inconvenience.

You might wonder why an *SDAT* contains files that contain things, when the *SDAT* could in theory simply contain the items itself. It's structured this way so that games can easily load groups of related sounds at the same time. For example, there's no point in loading the instruments for the battle music if you're on the main menu)

*SWAV*\ : short stream
----------------------

An *SWAV* ("sound wave") file is a short mono audio clip that can optionally be looped. This is usually a single note played by an instrument, or a sound effect. Even though these contain the raw audio data for sound effects, games never directly look for *SWAV*\ s when they want to play a particular sound effect. Instead, they'll instead reference entries within *SSAR* files, which in turn indirectly reference the appropriate *SWAV*\ s.

These can usually only be found within *SWAR* files.

*SWAR*\ : folder of *SWAV*\ s
-----------------------------

A *SWAR* ("sound wave archive") file is essentially a folder of *SWAV* files. The files within are unnamed, and can only be referenced by number.

*SBNK* files use these.

*SBNK*\ : folder of instruments
-------------------------------

An *SBNK* ("sound bank") file is a list of instruments that can be used by a sequence.

It can define up to four file IDs of *SWAR* files that contain the sound "samples" that its instruments need. Instruments within the *SBNK* can refer to a particular *SWAR* by specifying which of these file IDs to use (numbered beginning at 0; that is, 0, 1, 2, or 3).

There are three types of instruments, and all of them make use of "note definitions":

Note definition
+++++++++++++++

A note definition defines one note that an instrument can play. It includes all of the following:

* A *SWAR* number (specifically, an index (0-3) into the *SWAR* ID list in the *SBNK*), and the number of an *SWAV* within it.
* Which note this is, as a number. Examples: 60 (middle C), 74 (high D), 46 (low Aâ™¯).
* Some technical parameters to fine-tune the sound: "attack rate", "decay rate", "sustain rate", "release rate" and "pan".

Even though a note definition only defines a single note (say, middle C), games can nevertheless use one note definition to play a variety of notes. This is done by playing the sample faster or slower as needed. Games calculate the rate at which samples need to be played automatically; you never need to deal with the specifics of it.

Single-note instrument
++++++++++++++++++++++

The simplest kind of instrument. This contains one note definition and nothing else.

Remember, that doesn't mean that only one note can be played on this instrument. The game can calculate any other notes based on this one.

Range instrument
++++++++++++++++

Instruments of this type declare a range of note numbers (for example, 60 through 72), and contain one note definition per number in that range. The note numbers defined in the note definitions may not always match what you'd expect them to be given their positions in the range.

Regional instrument
+++++++++++++++++++

This type of instrument declares up to eight non-overlapping "regions" that together span the entire range of valid notes (0 through 127). Each region gets one note definition, from which the game can calculate the other notes in that region.

*SSEQ*\ : sequenced music
-------------------------

A *SSEQ* ("sound sequence") file is a single piece of sequenced music. It includes:

* the ID number of an *SBNK*
* technical stuff: volume, "channel pressure", "polyphonic pressure", "play"
* a list of events

Events are semantically similar to those in *midi* files. They're essentially commands that explain how the song is to be played. They include notes and rests, as well as directives to change instruments, to start multiple tracks playing at once, to jump, to loop, and much more. Events can also have parameters; the amount and meaning of them varies based on the type of event.

*SSAR*\ : sequenced sound effects
---------------------------------

A *SSAR* ("sound sequence archive") file contains a set of sequences representing sound effects. Each effect includes all of the metadata of an *SSEQ*, but they all share a single pool of events. Effects are made different by setting them to begin at different locations in the event pool. They avoid overlapping with each other by using lots of events that end the current track.

Effects often take advantage of the shared event space by using jump events to share events with each other. This can sometimes make it tricky to edit individual effects without inadvertently messing others up.

*Sequence player*\ : limits for sequences
-----------------------------------------

A *Sequence player* defines the maximum number of sequences that can be played at once, and the overall amount of memory that can be allocated at once to hold sequence data. It also lists the hardware sound channels that may be used for playing sequences, to avoid conflicts with any streams that may be playing at the same time.

Some games use multiple sequence players at once. When they do, the maximum number of sequences that can play concurrently will be small for each one, the amount of memory to allocate will be set to zero (to be calculated at runtime instead), and no allowed hardware channels will be listed (also to be calculated at runtime).

*STRM*\ : multi-channel stream
------------------------------

A *STRM* ("sound stream") is essentially a *SWAV* that also supports multiple channels. Whereas *SWAV*\ s are used for instrument sounds, these are used for full music tracks. They stand on their own and don't reference any other files.

*Stream player*\ : allowed channels for streams
-----------------------------------------------

A *Stream player* lists the hardware channels that *STRM*\ s may play on. This is needed to avoid conflicts with sequenced sounds that may be playing at the same time.

For example, [6, 7] means that the first channel of the first stream to be played should be played on hardware channel 6, and the next should be on 7 (both zero-indexed). Attempts to play more than two *STRM* channels in this example would fail.

*Group*\ : group of items
-------------------------

A *Group* is a collection of IDs of items that exist elsewhere in the *SDAT*. These items can be of different types. Games can use these to easily group together files that should be loaded at the same time.
